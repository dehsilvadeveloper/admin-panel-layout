<h1 align="center">
  Admin Panel Layout
</h1>

# Description

This repository contains the code for a simple admin panel page using *HTML* and *CSS*. The project works as knowledge refinement and skills showcase.

# Features

- Responsive design: The page adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- Flexbox: The CSS layout model used in this project provides a flexible way to align elements and distribute space within a container element, making easier to create more complex layouts and responsive web pages.
- Mobile first approach: Meaning that the styles are projected for mobile before designing for desktop or any other devices, which can lead to a faster display of the page on smaller devices.
- Styles directory architecture: The directories of the styles are organized on a approach similar to the **7-1 pattern** used for [Sass](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern).
- Interactive components: The page includes interactive elements such as buttons and hover effects.
